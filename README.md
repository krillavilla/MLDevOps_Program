# MLDevOps Engineer Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Kashad Turner-Warren, and this is my personal portfolio built through Udacity's **Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Program**. This program strengthened my ability to build scalable, production-ready machine learning systems and pipelines. It combines software engineering, DevOps, and machine learning into real-world projects that demonstrate my capabilities and aspirations as a next-generation ML/MLOps engineer.

---

## üåü Program Focus & Goals

This program sharpened my ability to:
- Deploy ML models in production environments without relying solely on cloud tools like SageMaker.
- Automate retraining pipelines using CI/CD and CT (Continuous Training) workflows.
- Monitor live model performance and detect drift for retraining or alerting.
- Engineer reproducible pipelines using MLflow, FastAPI, GitHub Actions, and more.
- Understand MLOps workflows from experimentation to scalable deployment and maintenance.

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems in cybersecurity and automation using AI. These projects reflect my ability to merge data science, infrastructure, and DevOps into secure, scalable systems.
